To join CMS Connect, you will need to possess a Globus ID. These instructions
will guide you through the process of creating a Globus ID or using your
existing Globus to gain access to CMS Connect.

1. Visit the CMS Connect sign up page and click on the Continue button.
This takes you to a page which will let you create a Globus ID or log in if you
already have an one.

existing account or continue with the current Globus account. Click on the
No Thanks, continue button to continue the application process

While completing the application, please provide your institutional email and a
valid phone number so that we can contact you. It is important that you choose
your Globus ID in the username dropdown menu:

In the next few minutes, you should get an automated email message that
acknowledges the receipt of your application. Within the next business day, you
will get a phone call or an email from us. Otherwise, contact the user support
team at [cms-connect-support@cern.ch](mailto:cms-connect-support@cern.ch).

If you expect to work with a team that is already using CMS Connect, you might
visit the Project Summary page to look for it. Click the project name there for
additional information, or to join the project. This can accelerate your access
to CMS Connect in some cases.
