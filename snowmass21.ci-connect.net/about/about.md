The Snowmass 2021 process is organized by the Division of Particles and Fields [DPF](DPF) of the American Physical Society. Snowmass is an opportunity for the entire HEP community to come together to identify and document a vision for the future of particle physics in the U.S. and its international partners.  The home website is [https://snowmass21.org/][https://snowmass21.org/).

Snowmass Connect is a job submission service to the [https://www.opensciencegrid.org/](Open Science Grid) in support of the Energy Frontier Monte Carlo Task Force working group.  More information can be found on the [https://snowmass21.org/energy/start](Energy Frontier wiki) and [https://indico.fnal.gov/category/1134/](Indico) pages. 

Also, you are also welcome to provide input and suggestions on Slack [https://snowmass2021.slack.com/](https://snowmass2021.slack.com/).
