The Snowmass Process is organized by the Division of Particles and Fields [DPF](DPF) of the American Physical Society. Snowmass is an opportunity for the entire HEP community to come together to identify and document a vision for the future of particle physics in the U.S. and its international partners.

We aim for everyone's voice to be heard. Your contributions and participation are critical for the success of Snowmass and they will naturally occur as part of one or more working groups directed by the conveners. There will be various Town Hall meetings for us to communicate with you and to receive your feedback. You are also welcome to provide input and suggestions on the Slack channel [https://snowmass2021.slack.com/](https://snowmass2021.slack.com/). This Snowmass wiki provides news and announcements and has pages dedicated to each frontier. If you are an early career scientist, we encourage you to join the “Snowmass Young” mailing list (snowmass-young@fnal.gov) by emailing to listserv@listserv.fnal.gov with the body of the message “Subscribe snowmass-young YOUR NAME”. Agendas and presentations of all Snowmass-related meetings are available via this [Snowmass Indico link](https://indico.fnal.gov/category/1098/).
