The Snowmass 2021 process is organized by the [Division of Particles and Fields](https://www.aps.org/units/dpf/) of the American Physical Society. Snowmass is an opportunity for the entire HEP community to come together to identify and document a vision for the future of particle physics in the U.S. and its international partners.  The home website is [https://snowmass21.org/](https://snowmass21.org/).

Snowmass Connect is a job submission service to the [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/) in support of the Energy Frontier Monte Carlo Task Force working group.  More information can be found on the [Energy Frontier wiki](https://snowmass21.org/energy/start)  and [Indico](https://indico.fnal.gov/category/1134/) pages. 

Also, you are also welcome to provide input and suggestions on Slack [https://snowmass2021.slack.com/](https://snowmass2021.slack.com/).
