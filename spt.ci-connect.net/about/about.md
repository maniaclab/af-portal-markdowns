## SPT Connect

SPT Connect offers collaboration access to two dedicated analysis servers, `amundsen.grid.uchicago.edu` and `scott.grid.uchicago.edu`.  From these you can submit to the high-throughput computing resources of the Open Science Grid, and to the "friends queue" provided by the ATLAS group at UChicago.

If you are a member of the SPT organization, you can visit the docs [here](https://github.com/SouthPoleTelescope/spt3g_software/blob/master/doc/osg/osg_guide.md)
