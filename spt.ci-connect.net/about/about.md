## SPT CI Connect

The South Pole Telescope (or SPT) is a telescope deployed at the South Pole
that is designed to study the Cosmic Microwave background. Constructed between
November 2006 and February 2007, the SPT is the largest telescope ever deployed
at the South Pole. This telescope provides astronomers a powerful new tool to
explore dark energy, the mysterious phenomena that may be causing the universe
to accelerate. We invite you to explore these pages to share in our experiences
during the design, construction, and (currently) operation of this powerful
telescope.
