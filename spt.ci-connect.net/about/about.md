## SPT Connect

SPT Connect offers collaboration access to two dedicated analysis servers, `amundsen.grid.uchicago.edu` and `scott.grid.uchicago.edu`.  From these you can submit to the high-throughput computing resources of the Open Science Grid, and to the "friends queue" provided by the ATLAS group at UChicago.
