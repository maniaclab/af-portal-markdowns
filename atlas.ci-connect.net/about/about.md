## ATLAS Connect

ATLAS Connect offers access to high-throughput computing resources from various opportunistic sources.  A login host, login.usatlas.org, provides a HTCondor job submission service.  The service is not an official part of the US ATLAS Computing Facility and is offered on a best-effort basis by the ATLAS group at the University of Chicago.
