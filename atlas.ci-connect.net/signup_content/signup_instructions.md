To join ATLAS Connect, you will need to possess a Globus ID.
These instructions will guide you through the process of creating a Globus ID
or using your existing Globus to gain access to ATLAS Connect.

1) Visit the ATLAS Connect sign up page. Either click on the Globus ID
link or select Globus ID in the dropdown menu and click on the Continue button.
This takes you to a page which will let you create a Globus ID or log in if you
already have an one.

link an existing account or continue with the current Globus account. Click on
the No Thanks, continue button to continue the application process

3) To complete your sign up, submit an application to join the atlas group.
While completing the application, please provide your institutional email and a
valid phone number so that we can contact you. It is important that you choose
your Globus ID in the username dropdown menu:

4) Finally, to complete the sign up process, join your institution's group
on the the Project Summary page.

In the next few minutes, you should get an automated email message that
acknowledges the receipt of your application. Within the next business day,
you will get a phone call or an email from us. Otherwise, contact the user
support team at [support@connect.usatlas.org](mailto:support@connect.usatlas.org).

If you expect to work with a team that is already using ATLAS Connect, you might
visit the Project Summary page to look for it. Click the project name there for
additional information, or to join the project. This can accelerate your access 
to ATLAS Connect in some cases.
